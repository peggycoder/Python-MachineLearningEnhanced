# MACHINE LEARNING in Python, with examples

## Requirements
To run the examples of this project it is necessary to have the following libraries installed, installing them with pip:

```ssh
$ pip install -U numpy
$ pip install -U pandas
$ pip install -U matplotlib
$ pip install -U scipy
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
```

With the option '-U' it updates us to the latest version of the library although we already have it installed.
